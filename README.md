This is a mod in my world version 1.18.2, which is Fabric Mod,



The installation method is as follows (the following contents are handling instructions):



The first type, the third party direct installation, the second type, the official installer installation



The game downloaded by the third-party launcher can be downloaded and installed directly



The official installer needs to enter the official website（ https://fabricmc.net/use/ )



Download the installer and install it directly. After installation, open the game root directory (. minecraft) directly. You can find that a new folder named mods has been generated. Just drag mod into it



Note: Because the API and ontology of fabric are separate, but most MODs also need APIs, so you need to download Fabric-API（ https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/ )



After downloading, put it into the Mods folder to start the game and play safely
